# Clinical Events & Specialties

The Clinical Events & Specialties module identifies specialties
associated with a user-provided clinical event (ex: an asthma diagnosis)
and evaluates the distribution of specialties associated with said event
at the encounter level. This functionality allows users to evaluate the
care patterns associated with a given cohort and determine if they are
expected.

## Installation
