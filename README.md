The Clinical Events & Specialties module identifies specialties associated with a user-provided clinical event (ex: an asthma diagnosis) and evaluates the distribution of specialties associated with said event at the encounter level. This functionality allows users to evaluate the care patterns associated with a given cohort and determine if they are expected.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('ssdqa/clinicalevents.specialties')
