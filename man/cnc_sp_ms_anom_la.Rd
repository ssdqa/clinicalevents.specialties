\title{\strong{Multi-Site Anomaly Longitudinal}
Function to generate output displaying the Euclidean distance between two time series}
\usage{
cnc_sp_ms_anom_la(
  process_output,
  grp_vars,
  specialty_filter = NULL,
  large_n = FALSE,
  large_n_sites = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{process_output}{output from \code{cnc_sp_process}
should contain the columns specified in \code{grp_vars}}

\item{grp_vars}{vector of variables used for grouping when identifying all-site summary statistics}

\item{specialty_filter}{a string indicating the SINGLE specialty of intereset that should be displayed at one time}

\item{large_n}{a boolean indicating whether the large N visualization, intended for a high
volume of sites, should be used; defaults to FALSE}

\item{large_n_sites}{a vector of site names that can optionally generate a filtered visualization}
}
\value{
three graphs:
\enumerate{
\item line graph that shows the smoothed proportion of visits with a
specialty across time computation with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item line graph that shows the raw proportion of visits with a
specialty across time computation with the Euclidean distance associated with each line
\item a bar graph with the Euclidean distance value for each site, with the average
proportion as the fill
